# GAMDL Web Interface - GitHub Pages

This directory contains the GitHub Pages landing page for the GAMDL Web Interface project.

## What is this?

The `docs/index.html` file serves as a beautiful, responsive landing page that showcases the GAMDL Web Interface. Since GitHub Pages can only host static websites (not Python Flask applications), this page provides:

- **Project Overview**: Clear description of what GAMDL Web does
- **Feature Highlights**: Key capabilities and benefits
- **Demo Preview**: Visual representation of the interface
- **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step setup instructions
- **Live Demo Status**: Information about accessing the web interface

## Accessing the Page

Once GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch and "/docs" folder
5. Save the settings

Your GitHub Pages site will be available at: `https://nyatanvn.github.io/gamdl/`

## For the Live Web App

To actually use the GAMDL Web Interface (not just view the landing page), users need to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the Flask application locally
4. Access it at `http://localhost:5000`

The landing page provides clear instructions for this process.
